A simple web app for Donuts Factory where users place orders and check status.

### Day 1: Basic Interaction

- Display welcoming message.
- Ask for order type (Donut, Coffee, Ice cream, Bakery).
- Ask for order name.
- Alert order preparation.

### Day 2: Input Validation and Storage
- Validate gender input with a while loop.
- Save answers in an array `[username, gender, type of Order, Order name]`.

### Day 3: Refactoring with Functions
- Creating a `functionTask` branch.
- Adding a function for the gender question.

### Day 4: DOM Manipulation
- Adding user inputs to the HTML page.
- Creating a `div` with an `id` so it can be accessed in JS.
- In the JS file, use the following structure:
